# What is mythicdraft?

Mythicdraft is a MTGO log vizualisation tool I attempted to monetize at one point. Then I realized it was just a cool thing that everyone should have. After that I the utter insanity of MTGO's set-character coding convention forced me to stopp playing whack a mole with their inane draft log file format. Perhaps it's changed since then?
